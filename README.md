# Closet Inventory/Search

I'm beginning to write code in order to create an inventory, search, categorize, etc. for all the clothing in my closet

*Article* is the parent class for types of clothing -- right now, just *Shirt* and *Pants* but more will be added later.

*Closet* is the class I built to store Articles, as well as use functions like search, add, display, etc.

*GUI* is the interface (using Java Swing) and is very much in the works at the moment; I am ironing out the technical problems before I adjust the look of it, so please excuse the appearance.

Finally, *CSVReader* is the code written in order to store the data used by the aforementioned classes in a CSV file.
